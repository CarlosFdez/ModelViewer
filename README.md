# ModelViewer
Simple DX11 learning project for myself. Feel free to use as an example for using DirectX 11.

This project uses Alain Galvan's CrossWindow project and a few others like GLM as submodules. 
Clone this project using ` --recurse-submodules` or run `git submodule update --init` in the root directory.

To build, CMake 3.13 is required. If you want to use Visual Studio's Open Cmake functionality, VS 2019 is required.
Otherwise using CMake to generate a solution will suffice.
